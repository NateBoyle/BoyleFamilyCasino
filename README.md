# BoyleFamilyCasino
Virtual casino created as a family Christmas gift. Includes video poker, blackjack, and a slot machine.

For the music files you will need to download from this Google Drive as the file sizes are too large: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1a6nfcfIWPDE66iYZYSJnoXW9joP_UNn5?usp=drive_link

-Make sure the files are stored in a 'music' folder.

-This shared drive also contains a zip with all of the necessary assets and files and an executable that allows you to play the game from your desktop with no Python installation necessary.

Here is a link to my portfolio website where there is a detailed section and video demo for the application: https://www.n8spage.com/software-applications
