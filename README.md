# BoyleFamilyCasino
Virtual casino created as a family Christmas gift. Includes video poker, blackjack, and a slot machine.

For the music files you will need to download from this Google Drive as the file sizes are too large: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1a6nfcfIWPDE66iYZYSJnoXW9joP_UNn5?usp=drive_link

-Make sure the files are stored in a 'music' folder.

-This shared drive also contains a zip with all of the necessary assets and files and an executable that allows you to play the game from your desktop with no Python installation necessary.

Here is a LinkedIn post where I give a video demo of the game: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/n8cboyle_python-programming-appdevelopment-activity-7145345164859850752-Vmuv?utm_source=social_share_send&utm_medium=member_desktop_web&rcm=ACoAABXD-TYB5v2QuLzNhbfNB2Xg4QA0ZJoWc9I
